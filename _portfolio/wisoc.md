Worked under Prof. Yashvardhan Sharma and developed Machine Learning Models using transformers, stacked embeddings and work vectors for detection of hate speech in Tweets. We had also used back-translation as a dat augmentation technique to obtain more training data.
Considered Models:
* XLM-RoBERTa
* FAIR Stacked Embeddings
* ULMFit
* FastText Word Embeddings

### Results
Achieved F1-weighted score of 0.90 for coarse-grained hostility detection and 0.54 F1-weighted score for fine-grained hostility identification
