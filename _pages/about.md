I am a Student Researcher at the Learning Agents Research Group LARG advised by Prof. Peter Stone in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for my Bachelor thesis. I am also interested in working tin the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and even using RL to solve NLP problems.
My previous research includes Maximum Entropy Formulation of RL, Distributional RL, Low Resource Language Dataset Generation, Image Feature Generation and HateSpeech Detection (Paper Presented at AAAI 2021). I have previously interned at Samsung Research Institute in which I worked on a recommender system. I also am a contributor to OpenAI's gym repository.

## My background and history

### Research
I am currently involved in research in Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I have previously worked in Computer Vision problems for improving the information obtained from an image by introducing a novel image feature based on NLP approaches. My interest is mainly in Conversational AI while I still enjoy exploring new applications for my fields.

#### Colaboration
I am working with Prof. Peter Stone (University of Texas, Austin) on the maximum entropy formulation of Reinforcement Learning.

I have worked with Prof. Heena Rathore (University of Texas, San Antonio), on distirbutional Reinforcement Learning.

During my Bachelors Degree here I was a part of three labs as an Researcher. 

* <a href="https://alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/appcair">Anuradha and Prashanth Palakurthi Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (APPCAIR)</a> (8/2021- 12/2021)
* <a href="https://alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/aiml">BITS AI/ML Lab</a> (12/2020- 12/2021)
* <a href="https://alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/wisoc">Web Intelligence & Social Computing Laboratory</a> (3/2020-12/2020)

### Work Experience
I have worked at:

* <a href="https://alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/sri">Samsung Research Institute, Delhi</a>, Research Intern (6/2021-7/2021)
* <a href="https://alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/wb">Tamil Nadu Health System Reforms Project</a>, a World Bank funded project, Data Analyst Intern (5/2020-6/2020)

### Education
Bachelor's Degree (B.E. (Hons.)) in Computer Science at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani). 2018-2022

I have been a Teaching Assistant for the following Courses:

* Deep Learning (CS F425)- Selected as one out of two TAs amongst students for the course when it started.
* Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic (BITS F312)

## My work and research

"Computers are my jetpack to propel me to my goals, Deep Learning is the additional nuclear booster pack."
*-Alfred*
I have published work related to detecting Hate Speech in tweets in Hindi and English.


I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.


## My intellectual communities

I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
