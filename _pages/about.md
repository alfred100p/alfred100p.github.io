I am an Undergraduate Researcher at the BITS AI/ML Lab and the APPCAIR AI Research Center. I am interested in Cognitive AI, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing and deep learning. My current projects include  <a href="#brl">bayesian reinforcement learning for optimal control</a> and <a href="#rpf">knowledge-based tasks for images</a>. I also am a contributor to OpenAI's gym repository.

## My background and history

### Education
I am currently a senior student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree (B.E. (Hons.)) in Computer Science at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani). During my time here I was a part of three labs as an Undergraduate Researcher. 

* <a href="https:alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/appcair">Anuradha and Prashanth Palakurthi Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (APPCAIR)</a> (8/2021- Present)
* <a href="https:alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/aiml">BITS AI/ML Lab</a> (12/2020- Present)
* <a href="https:alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/wisoc">Web Intelligence & Social Computing Laboratory</a> (3/2020-12/2020)

I am currently a Teaching Assistant for the following Courses:

* Deep Learning (CS F425)
* Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic (BITS F312)

### Colaboration
I am working with Prof. Heena Rathore (University of Texas, San Antonio), on <a href="#brl">bayesian reinforcement learning</a> for modelling uncertainity in pandemic situations to improve decision making for administrative policies.

### Work Experience
I have worked at:

* <a href="https:alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/sri">Samsung Research Institute, Delhi</a>, Research Intern (6/2021-7/2021)
* <a href="https:alfred100p.github.io/portfolio/wb">Tamil Nadu Health System Reforms Project</a>, a World Bank funded project, Data Analyst Intern (5/2020-6/2020)

## My work and research

"Computers are my jetpack to propel me to my goals, Deep Learning is the additional nuclear booster pack."
*-Alfred*
I have published work related to detecting Hate Speech in tweets in Hindi and English.


I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.


## My intellectual communities

I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
